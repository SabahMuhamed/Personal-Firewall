The Basic Firewall Simulator is a simple Python program that demonstrates how a firewall works by filtering network traffic based on predefined rules. Instead of using real network packets, the simulator generates random IP addresses and checks them against a set of rules to determine whether to allow or block the request.

This project is designed for beginners in network security and cybersecurity who want to understand the core concepts of firewalls, such as rule-based filtering and access control.
